# Omegon directive authority — code-level opinions over filesystem discovery

## Overview

Omegon is an opinionated engineering platform, not a flexible markdown tool. Its engineering opinions (testing, spec-first development, branch lifecycle, memory management) should be expressed as code-level authoritative directives, not as filesystem-discovered markdown files that compete with whatever random AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md exists in a cloned repo.

Pi is the Black Carapace — the flexible neural interface. Omegon is the Power Armor — opinionated, protective, and directive. The armor's opinions should be expressed through the interface, not as additional files sitting alongside the interface.

Near-term: embed critical opinions as promptGuidelines on always-loaded tools.
Medium-term: session_start engineering standards injection via sendMessage.
Long-term (Omega): coordinator owns the system prompt composition with explicit priority layering.

See research in parent node (test-coverage-directive-gap) for the full directive provenance audit.
