# Clipboard image paste into chat/messages

## Overview

Investigate and fix the failure path where a user cannot paste an image into the chat/message composer for inspection. Design should cover attachment intake, user feedback on paste success/failure, and compatibility with the existing read/view/render image flows.

## Research

### Current failure path diagnosis

Investigated vendor/pi-mono clipboard image paste path. In interactive mode, Ctrl+V invokes handleClipboardImagePaste() in vendor/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts, which calls readClipboardImage() and silently returns on any failure. On this macOS environment, the native clipboard bridge is unavailable because vendor/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/utils/clipboard-native.ts requires '@cwilson613/clipboard', but the vendored workspace currently has '@mariozechner/clipboard' installed in vendor/pi-mono/node_modules and no '@cwilson613/clipboard' module. Result: clipboard import resolves to null, readClipboardImage() returns null, and paste fails silently with no operator feedback.

## Decisions

### Decision: Clipboard image paste should tolerate both clipboard package scopes and surface operator-visible failure feedback

**Status:** decided
**Rationale:** The immediate regression is a missing native clipboard module due to package-scope mismatch in the vendored pi workspace. The paste path should try both known package scopes to remain compatible across rename/fork states, and the interactive handler should stop failing silently so operators can tell whether no image was present versus clipboard access/setup failed.

## Implementation Notes

### File Scope

- `vendor/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/utils/clipboard-native.ts` (modified) — Load native clipboard bridge from either known package scope to survive vendored rename/fork mismatch.
- `vendor/pi-mono/packages/coding-agent/src/modes/interactive/interactive-mode.ts` (modified) — Stop failing silently on image paste; emit status/warning feedback and preserve temp-file insertion behavior.

### Constraints

- Preserve existing Ctrl+V paste-image workflow and temp-file handoff to view/read.
- Do not silently broaden behavior beyond image paste; only improve module loading compatibility and operator feedback.
- Keep non-image clipboard cases non-fatal, but visible enough to debug.
